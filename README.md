# Intro to Loops and Conditionals

An introductory lab to loops and conditionals in JavaScript/

#### Learning Objectives

- Practice using conditionals and / or loops to solve problems

#### Prerequisites

- Introductory lesson to JavaScript

---

## Getting Started

1. Navigate into the `student_examples` folder for today.

2. Create a file called `morning_lab_solutions.js` .



## Directions
Write loops, `if`, or `if, else` statements to complete the following questions. Some of the problems may require you to use a loop inside the conditional. Refer back to your class notes from today if you need help.

## Conceptual Questions

Rate your understanding of the following questions on a scale of 1 - 5. If your understanding is less than or equal to 3, research the answer or ask for help:

1. How do we assign a value to a variable?
  - Which line(s) is/are valid?

    ```js
    let a = 0;
    const b = 1;
    9 = a;
    b = b + 5;
    ```

2. How do we change the value of a variable?
3. How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?

## Let's get Mathy!

```js
const a = 42.78
const b = 1.1
const c = -2
const d = .5
const e = 16
```

- Round `a` down
- Round `b` up
- Find the absolute value of `b - a`
- Find the largest number of `a, b, c, d, e`
- Find the smallest number of `a, b, c, d, e`
- Find the square root of `e`
- Raise `e` to the power of `d`
- Make a digital die 0 generate a random number between 1 - 6 

## Strings Activity 1

### Strings - Switcharoo
1. Create a variable called `firstVariable`.
1. assign it the value of a string: `"Hello World"`
1. On the next line, change the value of this variable to a number.
1. store the value of `firstVariable` into a new variable called `secondVariable`
1. On the next line, change the value of `secondVariable` to a string.
1. What is the value of `firstVariable`?

### Strings - Combine it
1. Create a variable called `yourName` and set it equal to your name as a string.
  - Write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable `yourName` so that it prints a new string with them concatenated

>ex: `Hello, my name is Jean Valjean`

## Booleans Activity
- Using the provided variable definitions, replace the blanks with a mathematical or boolean operator **that evaluates the expression to true**.

[MDN Comparison Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators)

```
  const a = 6;
  const b = 100;
  const c = -5;
  const d = 3000;
  const e = 'Jelly Bean';
```

1.  a _ b;
1.  c _ d;
1.  'Peanut' _ 'Peanut';
1.  a _ b _ c;
1.  a _ a _ d;
1.  e _ 'Jelly Bean';
1.  48 _ '48';
1. 'e' _ 'Eh'
